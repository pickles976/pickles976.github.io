Hi! My name is Sebastian Gomez. I am a professional software engineer who also tutors in my free time.

I know not only the theoretical concepts of Computer Science that you would learn in a classroom setting, but also the real-world tools and processes used at companies like Amazon. I also know the soft skills and keywords and concepts you need to get a job in tech.

However rather than focusing on career tutoring or schoolwork, I want to help cultivate a love of programming and problem-solving. I am a firm believer that once someone experiences the joy of computing, it stops being a chore or homework and starts being more like a game or puzzle!

My approach is to work with kids’ interests and help them pick projects that align with those interests. The hard CS concepts will naturally arise as small pieces of each project, but they won’t be presented in a heavy-handed manner like they would in a classroom. A natural progression of exposure to traditionally difficult concepts helps cultivate a sense of curiosity-driven learning rather than stress and test anxiety. 

My main goal is to help students learn to think critically and break down large and seemingly hard problems into small ones that can be tackled right away, or with just a little bit of extra study. I want my students to be just as excited about programming as I am!

If your child has expressed interest in programming, feel free to reach out and schedule an appointment. My first session is free!
